# Bag-O-Words-NLP

Implementation of the Bag of Words model of natural language processing.

Note:
  -The program file bag_o_words_sentiment.py is broken, there are a couple of fundamental mistakes in that because I was still learning.
  -The program file live_bag_o_words.py is the one to work with, that is cleaned up, documented, broken into functions and actually working.

Enjoy,
